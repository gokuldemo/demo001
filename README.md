\##To showcase devops fluency  
\### To record the start time of the project - The TIME is 18:34 GMT!!  

**Scope**:  

The scope of this project is to demonstrate the automation of deploying an infrastructure that can host a two tier web application. The setup will comprise of two application servers that will be hosting a Go application which are compiled using gccgo-go. The application servers will be behind a web server which will have Nginx installed and configured to balance the load between the two application servers and to act as a proxy.

**Assumptions**:  

This exercise has been done with the following assumptions:  
1. The code will be used in a Ubuntu virtual server environment.  
2. It is assumed that the system used to test / evaluate this code will have Ruby and other associated tools defined in Pre-Requisites section installed in it.   

**Pre-Requisites**:  
1. git  
2. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)  
3. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)  
4. [ChefDk](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)   
5. [Vagrant-Berkshelf](https://github.com/berkshelf/vagrant-berkshelf)  
6. [Test Kitchen - Vagrant](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-vagrant)

**Installation Instructions:**   

1. Clone the repository using the command:
        git clone https://github.com/gokuldemo/demo001.git

2. Execute the wrapper by parsing the options to "deploy", "destroy" and "test" options to perform the corresponding actions:   
         **./wrapper.sh deploy** - Will deploy the infrastructure required and configure the environment to compile the source code and deploy the binary to the application server.   
       **./wrapper.sh destroy** - Will destroy the infrastructure and configuration that were created to execute this project.  
       **./wrapper.sh test** - Will deploy and run the test cases defined in the test framework.   

**Notes:**    
1. Considering the time factor to complete the given assignment, simple wrapper was written. Could have used better task management tools like rake which will give additional functionalities like guard, foodcritic, etc.,   
2. Everything could have been converged in a single Gemfile which could have been invoked using a single command (to achieve the least hazzle way) but it was not done for 2 reasons:  
    2.a. Virtual Box and Vagrant could not be installed using Gem  
    2.b. Libraries used in Gem could conflict with the ones installed on the system as a part of other installations like rvm, apt, etc.,
